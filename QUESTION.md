About Norah:
  1. How old is Norah? This affects icon size, vocabulary complexity, and
     layout.

She is 5 years old.


  2. Is she verbal, partially verbal, or non-verbal? This helps decide if the
     app is her primary communication tool or a supplement.

She sings but do not really speak appart from isolated words.

  3. Does she currently use any AAC system? (e.g., PECS cards, a borrowed app
     like Proloquo2Go, TouchChat, or a paper-based board?) If so, what does
     she like/dislike about it?

She doesn't but we'r thinking about it. 

  4. What's her motor skill level? Can she tap small targets on a screen, or
     does she need larger buttons? Does she use any assistive input (switch,
     eye gaze)?

she has good motor skills!

  5. Can she read, or does she rely entirely on pictures/symbols?

She can't read

  About usage:
  6. What device(s) will she primarily use this on? iPad, Android tablet,
     phone, laptop?

iPhone and iPad

  7. Does she need text-to-speech (tap a symbol and it speaks out loud)? If
     so, any language preference (English, French given your name, other)?

Yes, both english and french

  8. Do you want a simple grid board (like a static page of symbols she taps
     to speak) or something more dynamic like sentence building (she taps
     multiple symbols to build a phrase, then plays it)?

Both

  9. Should it work offline? This is important for use at school, in the car,
     etc.

Yes

  About vocabulary & customization:
  10. Do you want to be able to add custom symbols/photos? For example, photos
       of her actual toys, family members, her school, foods she likes?

Yes

  11. Do you have a rough idea of how many words/symbols she needs to start
      with? (Some kids start with 20-30 core words, others need hundreds.)

let's start with 20-30

  12. Should categories be involved? (e.g., "Food", "Feelings", "People",
      "Places", "Actions")

yes

  Nice-to-haves:
  13. Would you like a password-protected edit mode so Norah can't
      accidentally rearrange the board, but you can customize it?

no

  14. Any specific AAC apps you've seen and liked the look/feel of? This helps
       me understand your expectations.

Proloque seem to be the leader.

  Take your time answering -- even partial answers are helpful. I'll draft the
  PLAN.md once I understand Norah's needs better.
